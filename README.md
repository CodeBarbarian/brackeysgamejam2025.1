# brackeysgamejam2025.1

Found a github repository for some of the mechanics I want to include: https://github.com/real-ezTheDev/rogue-like-deckbuilder-tutorial/tree/ep1
Trying to implement this into the already existing codebase, let us try not to reinvent the wheel.


Cardbattler Powers:

P = Positive Effect N = Negative Effect

Lizard Brute:
-  Sharpened Scales = P) “Sharp scales protrude out of your skin, causing enemies to take thorns-damage every time they hit you” 

N1) “This transformation is quite painful for you ~ -5 MAX HP” 

N2) “The scales are quite large, and difficult to maneuver around in. Every time you use a card that blocks, you’re only able to perform block-actions for the rest of the turn” 

N3) “It seems that this mutation was quite premature. After five combats, these brittle spikes will shatter, and will not regrow”

- Armaments = P) "Defense is the best offense! Every time you gain block, deal that much damage to a random enemy"

N1) "This, however, makes your armor wear off pretty fast . . . You gain 50% less armor from all sources"

N2) "Due to you having augmented your armour to be heavier for it to be able to hit and take hits, it has begun slowing you down. Your attack-cards deal 25% less damage"

N3)  "Your armor is no longer good for anything other than bashing. You can no longer gain block for it to be used defensively"

- Bloodlust = P) "You have developed an "acquired taste" for your enemies' life-essence. Every attack heals you for 2 HP"

N1) "The bloodlust consumes you! You're no longer able to heal through any other means"

N2) " . . . it still doesn't taste the best, though. You have a 50% chance to heal from every attack"

N3) "Constantly reeking of blood terrifies others. Shopkeeper only sells you certain items and chance-encounters force you to take the worst options"

- Weapon Master = P) "You've become quite proficient in your craft. Start every fight with +2 strength"

N1) "So good in fact that you've forgotten about everything else! The turn you use an attack-card, you're unable to use any other type of a card"

N2) "You've become obsessed with weapons! Reward-screen only gives you attack-cards"

N3) "After experimenting with different weapons, you've come to realise your own is no longer enough. You're unable to use Slashes"
